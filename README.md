### Exercise 3
##### At what point does the processor start executing 32-bit code? What exactly causes the switch from 16- to 32-bit mode?

##### What is the last instruction of the boot loader executed, and what is the first instruction of the kernel it just loaded?

##### How does the boot loader decide how many sectors it must read in order to fetch the entire kernel from disk? Where does it find this information?
